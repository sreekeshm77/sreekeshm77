                                                            ABOUT ME
                                                                             
I have a strong academic background in Physics with an MSc and a Diploma in Computer Applications. To further enhance my knowledge and technical skills, I have earned multiple certifications in Data Analytics and Data Science. I am actively seeking a Data Analyst role where I can use my analytical skills, problem-solving abilities, and technical knowledge to support data-driven strategies and informed decision-making in an organization.

To keep up with the fast-changing tech landscape, I am currently enrolled in a 6-month course in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. This advanced training aims to deepen my understanding of AI/ML and provide me with the skills needed to tackle complex analytical challenges and drive innovation in the field.
